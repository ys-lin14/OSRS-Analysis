Context:\
The data consists of Defence and Hitpoint (health) experience earned over a 3 painful hours of training my Event-RPG-wielding Defence pure at monks in Edgeville. The Defence experience gain was obtained by using Microsoft Excel to record and take the difference of the total Defence experience every 10 minutes. This gain was then used to calculate the Hitpoint experience gain with 1.33 Hitpoint experience points being earned for every 4 Defence experience.
