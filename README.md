# OSRS-Analysis
Attack speed or accuracy?
A project investigating experience rates and hit probabilities in the game Old School Runescape (OSRS) to satisfying my curiosity.

Contents:
* data (rpg_data.csv, scim_data.csv along with their processed forms) 
  * consists of Defence and Hitpoint (health) experience recorded in Microsoft Excel over 6 hours of playing OSRS
  
* linear_regression
  * reading and writing files along with dataframe manipulation using pandas
  * ordinary least squares linear regression from scratch and using stats from SciPy
  * data visualization using Seaborn
  
Game Context:
The data was obtained from training my defence pure at monks in Edgeville. Presented with an iron scimitar which had attack bonuses but was slower versus a faster Event RPG (cosmetic weapon) without any attack bonuses, I wished to determine which was better.
